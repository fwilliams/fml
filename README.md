fml - Francis' Machine-Learnin' Library
===================================

This repository is a collection of PyTorch tools for machine learning. Currently it includes 
* A numerically stable implementation of the [Sinkhorn Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0895) for point sets in any dimension
* A vectorized implementation of the Chamfer Distance between point sets in any dimension
